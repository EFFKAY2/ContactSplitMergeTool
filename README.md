# ContactSplitMergeTool

This app has two options, option one is to input a file with multiple contacts and have the app extract them to seperate files,
option two is to input several files and have the program merge them to one large file.

The software is designed  that it uses minimal resources, that is, it does not burden the cpu or memory more than required, even if this makes things a bit slower than it could have been.

If you click the cancel button in the middle of a process, the task will stop, and the freshly generated files will be deleted.

If you have any feedback, please submit.
